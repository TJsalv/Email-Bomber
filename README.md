## **Step-by-Step Execution**

### **Step 1: Install Python**

- **Windows/Linux/macOS:**  
  ```bash
  python --version
````

If not installed, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

* **Termux (Android):**

  ```bash
  pkg update
  pkg upgrade
  pkg install python
  python --version
  ```

---

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EmailBomber.git
cd EmailBomber
```

* **Termux tip:** If `git` is not installed:

```bash
pkg install git
```

---

### **Step 3: (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**

* **Windows/Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

  Activate:

  * Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * Linux/macOS/Termux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

---

### **Step 4: Install Required Packages**

No external packages required — uses built-in Python libraries (`smtplib`, `os`, `time`).

---

### **Step 5: Run the Script**

```bash
python EmailBomber.py
```

*(Works on Windows, Linux/macOS, and Termux)*

---

### **Step 6: Provide Inputs**

1. Enter your **email** and **password**.
2. Enter **recipient emails** separated by commas.
3. Enter **subject** and **message**.
4. Enter **number of times** to send.

* The script will **retry login** if credentials are incorrect.

---

### **Step 7: Observe Output**

* Terminal displays banner and status messages:

```
Email sent to example@gmail.com! (1/5)
```

* Repeats for all recipients and the specified number of times.

---

### **Step 8: Done**

* Script finishes after sending all emails.
* You can rerun it anytime with new inputs.

## **Disclaimer**

This script is for **educational purposes only**. Do not use it for spamming or malicious activity. The author is not responsible for any misuse.

---

## **Tips**

* Use `clear_terminal()` in your script for a cleaner output.
* Never push real credentials to GitHub. Use test accounts safely.

```

You can save this as `README.md` and push it to your GitHub repo.  

If you want, I can **also create a `.gitignore`** for your project so any sensitive files (like testing credentials) aren’t uploaded. Do you want me to do that?
